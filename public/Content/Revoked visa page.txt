Your visa has been revoked

Dear Mr. Gares 
We issued you with a visa on 6th July 2017 to visit the UK, but our checks have revealed that you provided false documents as part of your application. 
Your visa has therefore been revoked, in accordance with paragraph 30A of the Immigration Rules.
The rules state:

(i) whether or not to the holder's knowledge, false representations were employed or material facts were not disclosed, either in writing or orally, for the purpose of obtaining the entry clearance; or 

(ii) a change of circumstances since the entry clearance was issued has removed the basis of the holder's claim to be admitted to the United Kingdom, except where the change of circumstances amounts solely to his exceeding the age for entry in one of the categories contained in paragraphs 296-316 of these Rules since the issue of the entry clearance; or 

(iii) the holder's exclusion from the United Kingdom would be conducive to the public good. 
 
You will find the reasons for your visa being refused in the notice, GV51 (NRA), below.

Yours sincerely



Entry Clearance Officer
